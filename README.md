# PostCardJavafx
This project was an initial attempt at creating a postcard quoting application for an old boss of mine. 

Users input card size, quantity, and type of paper in order to get a pricing quote from the program. Users can add mailing costs, or specify if the postcard bleeds out to the edges as well, and this is factored into the calculation. 

Paper prices can be imported into the program via csv, and the program outputs and saves quotes into another csv which stores alongside itself.

Technical notes:

First project creating any kind of widely executable java program in the form of a Jar. 

First time deploying and packaging with Maven. 

At the end of this project it was abunantly clear that a web app was the way to go. (see postcardappv2)

Gained further experience using javafx, and styling with javafx.
